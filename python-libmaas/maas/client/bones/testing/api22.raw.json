Available choices are: 'bcache' (Bcache layout), 'flat' (Flat layout), 'lvm' (LVM layout).\n:disk_erase_with_quick_erase: Use quick erase by default when erasing disks..         This is not a secure erase; it wipes only the beginning and end of each disk.\n:disk_erase_with_secure_erase: Use secure erase by default when erasing disks..         Will only be used on devices that support secure erase.  Other devices will fall back to full wipe or quick erase depending on the selected options.\n:dnssec_validation: Enable DNSSEC validation of upstream zones.         Only used when MAAS is running its own DNS server. This value is used as the value of 'dnssec_validation' in the DNS server config.\n:enable_analytics: Enable MAAS UI usage of Google Analytics. This helps the developers of MAAS to identify usage statistics to further development..\n:enable_disk_erasing_on_release: Erase nodes' disks prior to releasing..         Forces users to always erase disks when releasing.\n:enable_http_proxy: Enable the use of an APT and HTTP/HTTPS proxy.         Provision nodes to use the built-in HTTP proxy (or user specified proxy) for APT. MAAS also uses the proxy for downloading boot images.\n:enable_third_party_drivers: Enable the installation of proprietary drivers (i.e. HPVSA).\n:http_proxy: Proxy for APT and HTTP/HTTPS.         This will be passed onto provisioned nodes to use as a proxy for APT traffic. MAAS also uses the proxy for downloading boot images. If no URL is provided, the built-in MAAS proxy will be used.\n:kernel_opts: Boot parameters to pass to the kernel by default.\n:maas_name: MAAS name.\n:max_node_commissioning_results: The maximum number of commissioning results runs which are stored..\n:max_node_installation_results: The maximum number of installation result runs which are stored..\n:max_node_testing_results: The maximum number of testing results runs which are stored..\n:network_discovery: .         When enabled, MAAS will use passive techniques (such as listening to ARP requests and mDNS advertisements) to observe networks attached to rack controllers. Active subnet mapping will also be available to be enabled on the configured subnets.\n:ntp_external_only: Use external NTP servers only.         Configure all region controller hosts, rack controller hosts, and subsequently deployed machines to refer directly to the configured external NTP servers. Otherwise only region controller hosts will be configured to use those external NTP servers, rack contoller hosts will in turn refer to the regions' NTP servers, and deployed machines will refer to the racks' NTP servers.\n:ntp_servers: Addresses of NTP servers.         NTP servers, specified as IP addresses or hostnames delimited by commas and/or spaces, to be used as time references for MAAS itself, the machines MAAS deploys, and devices that make use of MAAS's DHCP services.\n:upstream_dns: Upstream DNS used to resolve domains not managed by this MAAS (space-separated IP addresses).         Only used when MAAS is running its own DNS server. This value is used as the value of 'forwarders' in the DNS server config.\n:windows_kms_host: Windows KMS activation host.         FQDN or IP address of the host that provides the KMS Windows activation service.
